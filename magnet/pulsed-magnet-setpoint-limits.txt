# Tension setpoint limits of pulsed power supplies
# =========================================

#  DRVL  driver low level limit
#  LOLO  IOC low-low level limit (ALARM)
#  LOW   IOC low level limit (ALARM)
#  LOPR  Low operating range
#  HOPR  High operating range
#  HIGH  IOC high level limit (ALARM)
#  HIHI  IOC high-high level limit (ALARM)
#  DRVH  driver high level limit
#  TSTV  Test value for setpoint load current.
#  TSTR  Range for load current variation in tests.
