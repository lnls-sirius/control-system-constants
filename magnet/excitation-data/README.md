# Excitation Data Files

This folder contains excitation data files for all Sirius magnets.
For TB and BO these files were generated using measurement data and the Matlab scripts
* <code>sirius_bo_create_excitation_files.m</code>
* <code>sirius_tb_create_excitation_files.m</code>
For TS and SI the files were created using corresponding magnet model's simulated fields, but ultimately they all will be generated from rotating coil and hallsensor measurements.
